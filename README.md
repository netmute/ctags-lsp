# CTags Language Server

A Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation using `ctags` for code completion and go-to definition.

This won't replace your dedicated language server, and it doesn't try to. The goal is to have a "better than nothing" language server that's trivial to setup for any language.

## Installation

```
brew install netmute/tap/ctags-lsp
```
